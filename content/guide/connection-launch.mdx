description: Launching shell connections in various different scenarios

## From the hub

Any shell connection added to XPipe will show up in the connection hub interface. From there, you can just click on it to establish a shell connection in your terminal:

![](/images/launch-hub.png)

By default, this action is triggered by a single click. If you prefer having to double-click a connection entry to launch it, you can enable this behavior in the connection settings menu:

## From actions

Via the action recorder mode, you can create an action shortcut to launch a connection in a terminal:

For more information on how to use the action shortcut system, check out there [actions page](/guide/actions).

<Callout type="info">Creating action shortcuts is supported for all actions in XPipe, not just shell launches itself.</Callout>

## From the terminal

If you are frequently using the terminal, it might be easier to launch a shell connections directly from within that existing local terminal instead of navigating to the GUI and launching the connections manually from there.

XPipe supports this with the `xpipe launch` command. The basic syntax is

```bash
xpipe launch <connection name>
```

to open a new shell session and

```bash
xpipe launch <connection name> -- <arg1> ... <argn>
```

to directly run a command in that remote shell and return.

The connection name can be specified either using the full name of the connection or only a partial name as long as it is unambiguous. It also supports globs, meaning that you don't have to type out full connection names and hierarchies in case it is a sub connection. Standard glob options like `*`, `**`, `[]`, `?` work the same way as they do for files.

For example, in the following scenario

![](/images/launch-ambiguous.png)

you can launch the WSL Ubuntu-24.04 instance with the following commands:

```bash
xpipe launch "local machine/wsl distributions/ubuntu-24.04"
xpipe launch "*/wsl distributions/ubuntu-24.04"
xpipe launch "*/wsl*/ubuntu-24.04"
xpipe launch "*/*/ubuntu-24.04"
xpipe launch "**/ubuntu-24.04"
xpipe launch "ubuntu-24.04"
xpipe launch "ubuntu-*"
xpipe launch "ubuntu-"
```

As long as it is unambiguous, everything works fine. However, the following command will not work due to there being multiple systems with a similar name:

```bash
xpipe launch "ubuntu"
```

In the end, it is the easiest option to just have distinct names for every system.

### Terminal profiles

If you want to start up a common set of connections in a predefined terminal layout, you can use the launch command to do that as well. For example, if you are using Windows Terminal, running the following commands:

```
wt -w 1 sp xpipe launch "local machine"
wt -w 1 sp xpipe launch "archlinux"
wt -w 1 sp xpipe launch "ubuntu-24.04"
```

will allow you to obtain the same split pane terminal configuration of the 3 connections every time.

This way, you can make use of the full CLI and features of your specific terminal to create custom tabs and split pane layouts. If you are using a multiplexer, you can do the same thing as well with the launch command.

## From a script

Using the XPipe [HTTP API](/api), you can instruct XPipe to launch shell connections either in the background or also in a new terminal window/tab. As an example, using the [Python API](/guide/python-api), you can start a shell connection and run commands like this:

```python
from xpipe_api import Client
import re

client = Client()

connection = "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b"

# This will start a shell session for the connection
# Note that this session is non-interactive, meaning that password prompts are not supported
shell_info = client.shell_start(connection)

# The shell dialect of the shell. For example cmd, powershell, bash, etc.
dialect = shell_info["shellDialect"]
# The operating system type of the system. For example, windows, linux, macos, bsd, solaris
osType = shell_info["osType"]
# The display name of the operating system. For example Windows 10 Home 22H2
osName = shell_info["osName"]

# Prints {'exitCode': 0, 'stdout': 'hello world', 'stderr': ''}
print(client.shell_exec(connection, "echo hello world"))

# Prints {'exitCode': 0, 'stdout': '<user>', 'stderr': ''}
print(client.shell_exec(connection, "echo $USER"))

# Prints {'exitCode': 127, 'stdout': 'invalid: command not found', 'stderr': ''}
print(client.shell_exec(connection, "invalid"))

# Extract ssh version from system
version_format = re.compile(r'[0-9.]+')
ret = client.shell_exec(connection, "ssh -V")
ssh_version = version_format.findall(ret["stderr"])[0]

# Clean up after ourselves by stopping the shell session
client.shell_stop(connection)
```
