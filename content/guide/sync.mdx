## About

XPipe can synchronize all your connection configuration data across multiple installations. It uses your own remote git repository for that. You can sync with this repository in all XPipe application instances the same way, every change you make in one instance will be reflected in the repository. This approach means that you have full control over your data as you can freely choose how and where to host this repository.

First of all, you need to create a remote repository with your git provider of choice. This repository has to be private.
You can then just copy and paste the URL into the XPipe remote repository setting.


<Callout type="warn">Make sure that your repository visibility is set to private. You don't want to leak your connection data.</Callout>

You also need to have a locally installed `git` client ready on your local machine. You can try running `git` in a local terminal to check.
If you don't have one, you can visit [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) to install git.



<Callout type="info">You don't have to enter a remote repository. Just enabling git sync without one will create and maintain a local repository. This can be useful if you're looking for having a history.</Callout>


## Authentication

There are multiple ways to authenticate. Most repositories use HTTPS where you have to specify a username and password.
Some providers also support the SSH protocol, which is also supported by XPipe.
If you use an SSH URL for git, you probably know how to configure it, so this section will cover HTTPS only.

You need to set up your git CLI to be able to authenticate with your remote git repository via HTTPS. There are multiple ways to do that.
You can check if that is already done by clicking on the `Test` button below the remote repository URL in XPipe.

Many special tools like this [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) handle the whole authentication automatically for you when installed.
Some newer git client versions can also authenticate via special web services where you just have to log in into your account in your browser.

There are also manual ways to authenticate via a username and token.
Nowadays, most providers require a personal access token (PAT) to authenticate from the command-line instead of traditional passwords.
You can find common (PAT) pages here:
- **GitHub**: [Personal access tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
- **GitLab**: [Personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html)
- **BitBucket**: [Personal access token](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/access-tokens/)
- **Gitea**: `Settings -> Applications -> Manage Access Tokens section`
Set the token permission for repository to Read and Write. The rest of the token permissions can be set as Read.

If XPipe asks you for your git login credentials every time, you need to configure your command-line git client if you don't want to enter them every time.
You can use any git credentials manager for that.
For more information, see for example:
- [https://git-scm.com/doc/credential-helpers](https://git-scm.com/doc/credential-helpers)
- [https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git)

If everything works out, XPipe should push a commit to your remote repository.

## Syncing categories

By default, no connection categories are set to sync so that you have explicit control on what connections to commit.
So at the start, your remote repository will be empty.

To have your connections of a category put inside your git repository,
you need to click on the gear icon (when hovering over the category)
in your `Connections` tab under the category overview on the left side.
Then click on `Add to git repository` to sync the category and connections to your git repository.
This will add all syncable connections to the git repository.

## Local connections

Any connection located under the local machine cannot be shared as it refers to connections and data that are only available on the local system.

Certain connections that are based on a local file, for example, SSH configs, can be shared via git if the underlying data, in this case the file, have been added to the git repository as well.

## Adding files to git

When everything is set up, you have the option to add any additional files such as SSH keys to git as well.
Next to every file choice is a git button that will add the file to the git repository.
These files are also encrypted when pushed.
