description: Accessing your podman containers
---

XPipe supports connecting to and managing your podman containers on any local or remote system. For that it uses the `podman` commandline tool. [Searching for available connections](/guide/connection-search) on a system should make podman containers show up if the `podman` tool is added to the PATH on that system.

<Callout type="info">If you are using podman and symlinked the podman executable to docker, XPipe will ignore docker containers as it has the dedicated podman integration for that.</Callout>

## Daemon

The podman daemon must be running for the integration to work. If it is not running, you have to start the podman daemon service first.
