## Introduction

You have full access to SSH tunnel capabilities in XPipe. You are able to create local, remote, and dynamic tunnels that can be toggled on/off at any time. Tunnels can be created for any SSH-based connections. This includes VM connections, tailscale connections, teleport connections, and more.

## Local tunnels

If you are looking for a more user-friendly experience for tunnels, check out [services](/guide/services) instead. Raw SSH local tunnels it only makes sense to use instead of services if you want to use more advanced tunnel bindings.

The binding information you provide is passed straight to the `ssh` client as follows: `-L [origin_address:]origin_port:remote_address:remote_port`. By default, the origin will bind to the loopback interface if not specified otherwise. You can also make use of any address wildcards, e.g. setting the address to `0.0.0.0` in order to bind to all network interfaces accessible via IPv4. When you completely omit the address, the wildcard `*`, which allows connections on all network interfaces, will be used. Note that some network interfaces notation might not be supported on all operating systems. Windows servers for example don't support the wildcard `*`.

## Remote tunnels

Remote tunnels cannot be instantiated via any other means like services, so if you're looking to create one, you will have to use the remote tunnels.

The binding information you provide is passed straight to the `ssh` client as follows: `-R [remote_source_address:]remote_source_port:origin_destination_address:origin_destination_port`. By default, the remote source address will bind to the loopback interface. You can also make use of any address wildcards, e.g. setting the address to `0.0.0.0` in order to bind to all network interfaces accessible via IPv4. When you completely omit the address, the wildcard `*`, which allows connections on all network interfaces, will be used. Note that some network interfaces notation might not be supported on all operating systems. Windows servers for example don't support the wildcard `*`.

## Dynamic tunnels

Dynamic tunnels set up a connection that will forward traffic to a remote server, irrespective of the destination port. You can effectively use it as a [SOCKS5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) proxy server.

The binding information you provide is passed straight to the `ssh` client as follows: `-D [address:]port`. By default, the address will bind to the loopback interface. You can also make use of any address wildcards, e.g. setting the address to `0.0.0.0` in order to bind to all network interfaces accessible via IPv4. When you completely omit the address, the wildcard `*`, which allows connections on all network interfaces, will be used. Note that some network interfaces notation might not be supported on all operating systems. Windows servers for example don't support the wildcard `*`.
