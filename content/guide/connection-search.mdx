title: Connection search
description: Adding supported connections on remote systems
---

The automatic connection search is a fundamental part of XPipe. XPipe is designed around automatic detection without any manual configuration. For this reason, many integrations will detect automatically whether a supported component is installed on a remote system, and there is no way to manually configure the integration. If you're not sure how to add a certain type of connection for an integration, the automatic connection search is usually the first place to look.

You can find the connection search dialog either in the `New ...` menu:

![](/images/connection-search-menu.png)

or for any shell connection:

![](/images/connection-search-button.png)

Clicking on the button will automatically start the search for available and supported integrations. All detected integrations are shown with a checkbox to either select or unselect them. Integrations that were not found are greyed out:

![](/images/connection-search-dialog.png)

Just because in integration was found does not mean that it will work and is configured correctly. XPipe mainly checks for the existence of a certain installation, e.g., the presence of a certain executable like `docker` on the system. Whether your docker system in this case is running, configured correctly, and will work upon refresh, is not certain.

If a certain integration is not showing up as expected or is not working correctly even though it should, check out the individual integration guides to learn about the requirements of the integration to work in XPipe.
