description: Automatically adding connections on remote systems

## Introduction

The automatic connection search is a fundamental part of XPipe as everything is designed around automatic detection without any manual configuration. For this reason, many integrations will detect automatically whether a supported component is installed on a remote system, and there is no need to manually configure the integration.

If you're not sure how to add a certain type of connection for an integration, the automatic connection search is usually the first place to look.

## Adding connections

You can find the connection search dialog either in the `New` menu:

![](/images/connection-search-menu.png)

or for any shell connection in the button bar:

![](/images/connection-search-button.png)

Clicking on the button will automatically start the search for available and supported integrations. All detected integrations are shown with a checkbox to either select or unselect them. Integrations that were not found are greyed out:

![](/images/connection-search-dialog.png)

Clicking on ok will proceed to add the selected connections. This will, depending on the integration, either add sub connections automatically or not. For some integrations, you will still have to click on refresh to update the list of available children. Furthermore, some newly added integrations require something like a login or registration in order to work.

## Adding connections in bulk

Especially when starting out with XPipe, you might have to search for available connections on many new systems that were just added. For these cases, it is recommended to first turn off the setting to automatically show the search dialog when adding a new connection:

Then, you can use the [batch mode](/guide/hub#batch-mode) to search on multiple systems within one dialog:

![](/images/connection-search-batch.png)

This will show all available types of connections joined together. Ticking a certain connection type will add it for all systems where the connection type is supported:

## License requirements

Any integrations that require a license are still shown in the list, but are denoted as requiring a license. You can add these connections and interact with them somewhat without a license. Only certain actions like opening a terminal session are not supported. That way, you are able to verify whether everything is detected correctly and works before considering upgrading to a paid plan.

## Configuration

Just because an integration was found does not mean that it will work and is configured correctly. When adding connections, XPipe mainly checks for the existence of a certain installation, e.g., the presence of a certain executable like `docker` on the system. Whether your docker daemon in this case is running, configured correctly, and will work upon refresh, is not certain.

If a certain integration is not showing up as expected or is not working correctly even though it should, check out the individual integration guides to learn about the requirements of the integration to work in XPipe.
