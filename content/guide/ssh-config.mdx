## Introduction

XPipe fully supports using connections defined in SSH config files. In contrast to many other tools, this is not an import functionality where the config data is converted to internal data. Instead, the config file stays the backing store of the connection information. Any changes you make later on will be reflected in XPipe upon refresh.

Your local SSH configs apply to all SSH connections in XPipe, even if your config file is not added to XPipe or you created SSH connections within XPipe itself. This is important to keep in mind in case any wildcard options defined in your local config file affect other unrelated SSH connections in XPipe.

## Config files

XPipe can load all hosts and apply all settings that you have configured in the selected file. By specifying a configuration option on either a global or host-specific basis, it will automatically be applied to the connection established by XPipe.

[Searching for available connections](/guide/connection-search) on a system will automatically add the default SSH config file at `~/.ssh/config` if it exists. You can also add configs from other locations at `New -> Remote Host -> SSH config file`. XPipe supports wildcard definitions and include statements of other files as well, meaning that you will get a one-to-one application of your entire config in XPipe. It is exactly applied as it would if you use the `ssh` command-line client.

If you want to learn more about how to use SSH configs, you can use `man ssh_config` or read this [guide](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config).

## Custom SSH connections

If you want to create a fully customized SSH connection with more options than you can find in the simple SSH connection creation dialog, you can take a look at customized SSH connections. These allow you to specify an SSH connection in-place using the SSH config syntax you know. It is essentially a way to create SSH config connections without having to go through dealing with creating config files. This is recommended if you are an advanced user and know what you're doing.

### Format

You can specify connection details just as in an SSH config. The main difference is that you don't need to include an explicit host declaration. For example, the following definitions are semantically equivalent:

```
User user
HostName example.com
```

```
Host myhost
    User user
    HostName example.com
```

### Identities

Note that you can also specify an `IdentityFile` option in here. If any identity is specified in here, any otherwise specified identity later down below will be ignored.

### X11 forwarding

If any options for X11 forwarding are specified here like `ForwardX11`, XPipe will automatically attempt to set up X11 forwarding. For more information. see TODO.

### Jump hosts

You can also define multiple hosts if you need additional hosts to be used for certain options like `ProxyJump`. For example, you can also define the following 2 hosts for a custom SSH connection:

```
Host myhost
    User user
    HostName example.com
    ProxyJump jump

Host jump
    User jumpuser
    HostName jump.example.com
```

Note that it is recommended to use a proper SSH config file for cases like this as it is not possible for custom SSH connections to specify multiple different authentication credentials. Custom SSH connections are therefore mostly intended for simpler types of hosts and not jump chains.
