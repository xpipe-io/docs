description: Installing XPipe on your desktop
---

XPipe can be installed in many different ways on all operating systems. Which installation method you choose depends on your preferences and your requirements.

<Callout type="info">If you are looking for deploying XPipe in your organization and want to automate the installation and upgrade process across multiple systems, check out the managed installation guide instead.</Callout>

<Callout type="info">Note that this is a desktop application that should be run on your local desktop workstation, not on any server or containers. You don't need to set up anything on any servers with XPipe. All commands you see here should be run on your desktop system.</Callout>

## Windows

Installers are the easiest way to get started:

- [Windows .msi Installer (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-windows-x86_64.msi)

If you don't like installers, you can also use a portable version packaged as an archive:

- [Windows .zip Portable (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-windows-x86_64.zip)

Alternatively, you can also use the following package managers:
- [choco](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/xpipe) to install it with `choco install xpipe`.
- [winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) to install it with `winget install xpipe-io.xpipe --source winget`.


<Callout type="info">Right now there are no separate ARM64 builds for Windows. However, the x86-64 versions also work on Windows ARM systems via the built-in compatibility layer.</Callout>

## macOS

Installers are the easiest way to get started and come with an optional automatic update functionality:

- [MacOS .pkg Installer (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-macos-x86_64.pkg)
- [MacOS .pkg Installer (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-macos-arm64.pkg)

If you don't like installers, you can also use a portable version packaged as an archive:

- [MacOS .dmg Portable (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-macos-x86_64.dmg)
- [MacOS .dmg Portable (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-macos-arm64.dmg)

Alternatively, you can also use the official [homebrew tab](https://github.com/xpipe-io/homebrew-tap) to install XPipe with `brew install --cask xpipe-io/tap/xpipe`.

## Linux

You can install XPipe the fastest by pasting the installation command into your terminal. This will perform the setup automatically.
The script supports installation via `apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, `zypper`, `rpm`, and `pacman` on Linux:

```
bash <(curl -sL https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/raw/master/get-xpipe.sh)
```

You can find the source of the script [here](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/blob/master/get-xpipe.sh).

Of course, there are also manual installation methods for each distro available.

### Debian-based distros

The following debian installers are available:

- [Linux .deb Installer (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-linux-x86_64.deb)
- [Linux .deb Installer (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-linux-arm64.deb)

<Callout type="info">You should use apt to install the package with `sudo apt install xpipe-installer-linux-*.deb` as other package managers, for example dpkg,
    are not able to resolve and install any dependency packages.</Callout>

There also exists an apt repository that you can add as an additional source to apt. This will allow you to install and upgrade XPipe through apt itself without having to download any installer files. For instructions on how to use it, see the [managed installation guide](/guide/managed-installation#debian-based-distros).

### RHEL-based distros

The rpm releases are signed with the GPG key https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc.
You can import it via `rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc` to allow your rpm-based package manager to verify the release signature.

The following rpm installers are available:

- [Linux .rpm Installer (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-linux-x86_64.rpm)
- [Linux .rpm Installer (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-linux-arm64.rpm)

There also exists an rpm repository that you can add as an additional source to yum/dnf/etc. This will allow you to install and upgrade XPipe through your package manager itself without having to download any installer files. For instructions on how to use it, see the [managed installation guide](/guide/managed-installation#rhel-based-distros).

### Arch

There is an official [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xpipe) available that you can either install manually with

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xpipe
cd xpipe
makepkg -sirc
```

or via an AUR helper such as with [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) with

```bash
yay -S xpipe
```

### NixOS

There's an official [xpipe nixpkg](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=xpipe&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=xpipe) available that you can install with `nix-env -iA nixos.xpipe`. This one is usually not up-to-date.

There is also a custom repository that contains the latest up-to-date releases: https://github.com/xpipe-io/nixpkg.
You can install XPipe by following the instructions in the linked repository.

### Tarball

In case you prefer to use an archive that you can extract anywhere, you can use these:

- [Linux .tar.gz Portable (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-linux-x86_64.tar.gz)
- [Linux .tar.gz Portable (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-linux-arm64.tar.gz)

<Callout type="info">This portable version assumes that you have some basic packages for graphical systems already installed
    as it is not a perfect standalone version. It should however run on most systems.</Callout>

### AppImage

Alternatively, there are also AppImages available:

- [Linux .AppImage Portable (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-linux-x86_64.AppImage)
- [Linux .AppImage Portable (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-linux-arm64.AppImage)

<Callout type="info">This portable version assumes that you have some basic packages for graphical systems already installed
    as it is not a perfect standalone version. It should however run on most systems.</Callout>
