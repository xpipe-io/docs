## 1Password

The 1Password integration requires you to first install the [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/) and add it to the PATH. This executable is not included in the normal 1Password installation, so you will have to install it manually.

Once the `op` command is set up, you can instantly use it from XPipe. You will have to confirm the first access request to the vault, but afterwards it works automatically without user input:

1Password requires the password references to be in a very specific format. For more information, see the [1Password docs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/secret-reference-syntax/). In short, any secret you reference from XPipe has to have the form of `op://<vault>/<item>/<field>`, so for example `op://personal/myitem/password`.

## KeePassXC

The KeePassXC integration works over the KeePassXC browser extension interface, meaning that it will handle it the same way as the KeePassXC browser extensions if you have them installed. For this to work, you first have to enable the browser integration in KeePassXC at `Tools` -> `Settings`:

Then, upon the first request from XPipe, you should be prompted to allow XPipe to access your database, assuming that it is unlocked:

If you confirm this, XPipe will be able to retrieve passwords from KeePassXC.

Note that since XPipe uses the browser integration, XPipe can only access entries by their URL, not their name. Any entry has to be referenced by the URL field. In practice, the URL field doesn't have to be a valid URL; any name will also suffice.

## Bitwarden

The Bitwarden integration requires you to first install the [Bitwarden CLI](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/#download-and-install) and add it to the PATH. This executable is not included in the normal Bitwarden installation, so you will have to install it manually.

Once the `bw` command is set up, you will first have to log in initially via `bw login` or via a different command, depending on which authentication method to use. For more information, see the [Bitwarden docs](https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/#log-in).

If you are logged in, XPipe will be able to unlock the vault. For that, XPipe will initially prompt for the master password when Bitwarden is first used during a session:

Then, XPipe will be able to retrieve passwords from Bitwarden during the session using the entry's item name.

## Dashlane

The Dashlane integration requires you to first install the [Dashlane CLI](https://cli.dashlane.com/install) and add it to the PATH. This executable is not included in the normal Dashlane installation, so you will have to install it manually.

Once the `dcli` command is set up, you will first have to log in initially when XPipe first calls the command.

Then, XPipe will be able to retrieve passwords from Dashlane during the session using the entry's item name.

## Keeper

The Keeper integration requires you to first install the [Keeper Commander CLI](https://docs.keeper.io/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/commander-installation-setup) and add it to the PATH. This executable is not included in the normal Keeper installation, so you will have to install it manually.

Once the `keeper` command is set up, you will first have to log in initially when XPipe first calls the command.

If you are logged in, XPipe will be able to unlock the vault. For that, XPipe will initially prompt for the master password when Keeper is first used during a session.

Then, XPipe will be able to retrieve passwords from Keeper during the session using the record's UID, which you will have to look up for an entry first:

## LastPass

The LastPass integration requires you to first install the [LastPass CLI](https://github.com/LastPass/lastpass-cli) and add it to the PATH. This executable is not included in the normal LastPass installation, so you will have to install it manually.

Once the `lpass` command is set up, you will first have to log in initially when XPipe first calls the command.

Then, XPipe will be able to retrieve passwords from LastPass during the session using the *case-sensitive* entry name.

## Windows credential manager

On Windows, you have access to the [Windows credential manager](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/accessing-credential-manager-1b5c916a-6a16-889f-8581-fc16e8165ac0). XPipe can retrieve passwords from it by referencing the credential name.
