## Introduction

XPipe supports connecting to your systems that are added to your profile in Netbird. For that it uses the `netbird` commandline tool. [Searching for available connections](/guide/connection-search) on a system should make netbird connections show up if the `netbird` tool is added to the PATH on that system. If you have not installed the `netbird` tool, you can find installation instructions [here](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/installation). You don't need to use the GUI components of the Netbird installation, it will work exclusively through the CLI.

You will likely only add your remote netbird connections from your local machine. However, netbird connections are supported on any remote system as well and support gateways. So you can search for available netbird connections on any remote system that you have added a shell connection for.

## Netbird SSH

Netbird provides the [Netbird SSH feature](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/ssh) where the netbird daemon also handles your SSH networking and authentication on your systems, meaning you don't need to expose the SSH port. It is a step-up compared to the normal VPN functionality. At the time of writing this, this feature was completely broken, meaning that there was no possibility of adding support for it. Maybe in the future that can be added.

For this reason, XPipe will use netbird for networking only. This means that you will still have to provide your user authentication details to log into a server.

## Profiles and accounts

You can add multiple profiles to your netbird client at the same time without having to log out of one. Every account represents a different profile and set of connections. You can find instructions for that [here](https://docs.netbird.io/how-to/profiles). XPipe will detect all available accounts and profiles on a system automatically. It will automatically switch the active profile when you establish a connection in a certain profile.

<Callout type="info">Interacting with multiple profiles requires a Professional license. Such a setup is typically used for switching between personal and work VPN connections.</Callout>

## Daemon

The local netbird daemon application must be running for the integration to work. If it is running, it will typically show up in the system tray. If it is not running, you can quickly start the Netbird application, that will also start the daemon.

## Refreshing connections

XPipe can automatically refresh all available connections by clicking on the refresh button. This is useful if you recently added or removed peers. For the refresh to succeed, you need to be logged in into your netbird account and your login must not be expired. If you are not logged incorrectly, you will get an error message about that or a login window will popup automatically.

<Callout type="info">On a Linux system, netbird requires root permissions to access all profiles and accounts. XPipe will prompt you for your sudo password if needed.</Callout>
