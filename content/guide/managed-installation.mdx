## Introduction

If you're looking for options to install XPipe on systems either using some package manager, endpoint management tool, or your own scripts, this page contains the necessary information.

## Windows

### Winget

There is a winget package available that uses the .msi installer. It can be installed for your current user with the following command:

```powershell
winget install xpipe-io.xpipe --source winget
```

If you want to install the package for all users, you can do so by passing the machine scope and running the command as an Administrator:

```powershell
winget install xpipe-io.xpipe --source winget --scope machine
```

Note that due to the manual winget package PR approval process, new versions might take 1-2 days to become available in winget.

### Chocolatey

There is also a [choco package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/xpipe) that provides the same .msi installers. It can be installed for your current user with the following command:

```powershell
choco install xpipe
```

If you want to install the package for all users, you can do so by passing the ALLUSERS property and running the command as an Administrator:

```powershell
choco install xpipe --install-arguments="'ALLUSERS=1'"
```

### Scoop

There is also a [scoop package](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/blob/master/bucket/xpipe.json) in the extras bucket that provides the same .msi installers. You first have to make sure that the extras bucket is enabled with `scoop bucket add extras`. XPipe can then be installed for your current user with the following command:

```powershell
scoop install extras/xpipe
```

If you want to install the package for all users, you can do so by using the `--global` option and running the command as an Administrator:

```powershell
scoop install extras/xpipe --global
```

### PowerShell

You can install the .msi quietly just as other normal installers:

```powershell
$RawArch = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation,mscorlib]::OSArchitecture.ToString().ToLower();
$Arch = If ($RawArch -eq "x64") {"x86_64"} Else {"arm64"}
Start-Process -FilePath "msiexec.exe" -ArgumentList "/i `"https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-windows-$($Arch).msi`" /qn" -Wait -PassThru
```

It also supports the property `ALLUSERS` to control whether it should be installed only for the current user or all users on a system. If you run the following command with Administrator privileges, it will be installed for all users:

```powershell
$RawArch = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation,mscorlib]::OSArchitecture.ToString().ToLower();
$Arch = If ($RawArch -eq "x64") {"x86_64"} Else {"arm64"}
Start-Process -Verb runAs -FilePath "msiexec.exe" -ArgumentList "/i `"https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-windows-$($Arch).msi`" /qn ALLUSERS=1" -Wait -PassThru
```

## Linux

The rpm releases are signed with the GPG key https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc. So please make sure so check any releases against this GPG key. This can be done automatically by your package manager if you import the key.

### Debian-based distros

XPipe provides an apt repository at https://apt.xpipe.io. You can add this repository as an additional source to apt to be able to install XPipe through apt directly. The releases are signed with the GPG key https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.gpg. This command will perform the setup steps automatically:

```bash
sudo apt install wget gpg
wget -qO- https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.gpg > xpipe.gpg
sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 xpipe.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/xpipe.gpg
rm xpipe.gpg
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/xpipe.gpg] https://apt.xpipe.io/ stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/xpipe.list'
sudo apt update && sudo apt install xpipe
```

If you are looking for early access builds for new releases, you can replace the package name `xpipe` with `xpipe-ptb` to install the PTB build of XPipe from the repository.

### RHEL-based distros

XPipe provides an rpm repository at https://rpm.xpipe.io. You can add this repository as an additional source to your rpm-based package manager (yum, dnf, zypper, rpm, etc.) to be able to install XPipe through it directly. An upgrade operation will also install the latest XPipe release automatically.

The rpm releases are signed with the GPG key https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc. You can import it via `rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc` to allow your package manager to verify the release signature.

You can use the repository as follows:

#### Yum

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc
sudo yum install yum-config-manager
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.xpipe.io/xpipe.repo
sudo yum install xpipe --refresh
```

#### DNF 4

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.xpipe.io/xpipe.repo
sudo dnf install xpipe
```

#### DNF 5+

```bash
sudo dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile=https://rpm.xpipe.io/xpipe.repo
sudo dnf install xpipe
```

#### Zypper

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc
sudo zypper ar -f https://rpm.xpipe.io xpipe
sudo zypper install xpipe
```

If you are looking for early access builds for new releases, you can replace the package name `xpipe` with `xpipe-ptb` to install the PTB build of XPipe from the repository.

## macOS

The macOS [.pkg installer](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-macos-arm64.pkg) can be called from the command line as well to install XPipe silently:

```bash
curl --output xpipe-installer-macos-arm64.pkg https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-macos-arm64.pkg
sudo installer -verboseR -pkg xpipe-installer-macos-arm64.pkg -target /
```

### Homebrew

There is also a [homebrew tap](https://github.com/xpipe-io/homebrew-tap) that can be used to install XPipe as a cask. It can be installed with the following command:

```bash
brew install --cask xpipe-io/tap/xpipe
```
