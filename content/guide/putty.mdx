## Introduction

If you are using PuTTY (or KiTTY) and are now moving to XPipe, there are a few things to look out for.

## Import

Existing connections/sessions saved in PuTTY can be imported somewhat into XPipe on Windows by [searching for available connections](/guide/connection-search) on the local machine:

This will import connections from the registry. If your connections are not saved to the registry, e.g., when using a portable version of PuTTY/KiTTY, you can still import them by explicitly saving all session data to the registry as shown [here](https://superuser.com/questions/1536415/convert-portable-kitty-session-to-registry-kitty-session).

The imported data is not fully complete though. Passwords aren't imported and ppk keys can't be imported due to the format incompatibility.

## Keys

PuTTY has its own non-standard SSH key file format with .ppk files. This poses a challenge as these are not supported by OpenSSH, nor can they be automatically converted to the standardised .pem format. The best that you can do is manually export them into the correct format from PuTTY as shown in the [documentation](https://www.puttygen.com/convert-pem-to-ppk).

If you only have a few keys added to PuTTY, this manual convert option should work fine. For more keys, it might make sense to keep them in [PuTTY's pageant](https://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_pageant), which is the PuTTY equivalent to the SSH agent. You can configure a connection in XPipe to use pageant for keys:
