## Introduction

The XPipe Python API is a Python client for the XPipe HTTP API. It is essentially a wrapper for the raw [HTTP API](/api) and intended to make working with it more convenient.

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install xpipe_api
```

## Connecting to the XPipe application

To start out, you need to enable the API access in the XPipe settings. You can find that under **Settings** -> **HTTP API**. For only local API access, you don't need to worry about the API key in the settings menu.

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

# By default, Client() will read an access key from the file xpipe_auth on the local filesystem
# and talk to the XPipe HTTP server on localhost.
client = Client()

# If you want to connect to a PTB build of XPipe, you have to configure the client with that information
# as the PTB releases use a different port
client = Client(ptb=True)

# To connect to a remote instance with an API key, use
client = Client(token="foo", base_url = "http://servername:21721")
```

There's also an async version of the client that can be accessed as AsyncClient. All calls are run asynchronously with that client. This intro will only cover the sync client though.

```python
import asyncio
from xpipe_api import AsyncClient

async def main():
    client = AsyncClient()

    # Do your stuff async

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Querying connections

A connection reference is just a UUID string. You can query one or multiple connections stored in XPipe based on various filters.

[**API reference**](/api/connection-query)

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

client = Client()

# connection_query accepts glob-based filters on the category, connection name, and connection type

# Find all connections in the default category and all its subcategories
connections = client.connection_query(categories="Default/**")

# Find all connections in the default category without any subcategories
connections = client.connection_query(categories="Default/*")

# Find all top level connections in the default category
connections = client.connection_query(categories="Default", connections="*")

# Find all connections in the default category, including any sub connections
connections = client.connection_query(categories="Default", connections="**")

# Find all SSH config connections on the local machine
connections = client.connection_query(categories="Default", connections="Local Machine/SSH user config/*")

# Find only ssh config host connections in the "MyCategory" category that has the word "MyCompany" in its name
# - Searching for strings is case-insensitive here
# - This will not include subcategories of "MyCategory"
# - You can find all the available connection type names by just querying all connections and taking a look add the individual type names of the connections.
connections = client.connection_query(categories="MyCategory", types="sshConfigHost", connections="*MyCompany*")

# Query a specific connection by name in a category
# This will only return one element, so we can just access that
connection = client.connection_query(categories="MyCategory", connections="MyConnectionName")[0]

# Query the local machine connection
connection = client.connection_query(connections="Local Machine")[0]

# A connection reference is just a UUID string, so you can also specify it fixed
# If you have the HTTP API setting enabled in XPipe, you can copy the API UUID of a connection in its context menu
connection = "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b"
```

## Getting connection information

Since each connection reference is just a UUID string, you have to retrieve information for it using another API call.

[**API reference**](/api/connection-info)

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

client = Client()

connections = client.connection_query(categories="Default/**")

# Works in bulk, so it expects an array of connections
infos = client.connection_info(connections)
# Get the first info
info = infos[0]

# The connection UUID
uuid = info["connection"]
# This is an array containing all category hierarchy names
category = info["category"]
# This is an array containing all connection hierarchy names
name = info["name"]
# This is the connection type name that you can use in the query
type = info["type"]
# There is also some other data for internal state management, e.g. if a tunnel is running for example
```

## Adding connections

You can add custom connections as well.

[**API reference**](/api/connection-add)

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

client = Client()

# The raw connection data. You can find the internal json representation of any existing connection
# by querying it first. You can use that information to then create your own connection json representation
data = {
    "type": "shellEnvironment",
    "commands": None,
    "host": {
      "storeId": "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b"
    },
    "shell": "pwsh",
    "elevated": False,
}

# The target category to put this connection into
category = "97458c07-75c0-4f9d-a06e-92d8cdf67c40"

client.connection_add(name="My Connection", conn_data=data, validate=True, category=category)
```

## GUI actions

You can perform some actions for the desktop application from the CLI as well.

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

client = Client()

connection = "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b"

# Opens the file browser in a specified starting directory for a connection
client.connection_browse(connection, "/etc")

# Opens a terminal session in a specified starting directory for a connection
client.connection_terminal(connection, "/etc")

# Toggles the session state for a connection. If this connection is a tunnel, then this operation will start or stop the tunnel
client.connection_toggle(connection, True)

# Refreshes a connection. This operation is the same as for validating a connection when creating it by attempting whether the connection is functioning.
client.connection_refresh(connection)
```

## Shell operations

You can open remote shell sessions to systems and run arbitrary commands in them.

```python
from xpipe_api import Client
import re

client = Client()

connection = "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b"

# This will start a shell session for the connection
# Note that this session is non-interactive, meaning that password prompts are not supported
shell_info = client.shell_start(connection)

# The shell dialect of the shell. For example cmd, powershell, bash, etc.
dialect = shell_info["shellDialect"]
# The operating system type of the system. For example, windows, linux, macos, bsd, solaris
osType = shell_info["osType"]
# The display name of the operating system. For example Windows 10 Home 22H2
osName = shell_info["osName"]

# Prints {'exitCode': 0, 'stdout': 'hello world', 'stderr': ''}
print(client.shell_exec(connection, "echo hello world"))

# Prints {'exitCode': 0, 'stdout': '<user>', 'stderr': ''}
print(client.shell_exec(connection, "echo $USER"))

# Prints {'exitCode': 127, 'stdout': 'invalid: command not found', 'stderr': ''}
print(client.shell_exec(connection, "invalid"))

# Extract ssh version from system
version_format = re.compile(r'[0-9.]+')
ret = client.shell_exec(connection, "ssh -V")
ssh_version = version_format.findall(ret["stderr"])[0]

# Clean up after ourselves by stopping the shell session
client.shell_stop(connection)
```

## File system operations

You can interact with the file system of any remote shell as well.

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

client = Client()

connection = "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b"

# We need a shell for the file system
client.shell_start(connection)

# You are responsible for decoding files in the correct file encoding
file_bytes = client.fs_read(connection, "~/.ssh/config")
file_string = file_bytes.decode('utf-8')

# Writing files can be done via blobs
file_write_content = "test\nfile"
blob_id = client.fs_blob(file_write_content)
client.fs_write(connection, blob_id, "~/test_file.txt")

# You can do the same with script files as well
# This will create an executable script in the system's temp directory
script_write_content = "echo hello\necho world"
blob_script_id = client.fs_blob(file_write_content)
script_path = client.fs_script(connection, blob_script_id)

# You can then use this script for your commands
# Prints {'exitCode': 0, 'stdout': 'hello\nworld', 'stderr': ''}
print(client.shell_exec(connection, "\"" + script_path + "\""))

# Clean up after ourselves by stopping the shell session
client.shell_stop(connection)
```
