## Introduction

The XPipe Python API is a Python client for the XPipe HTTP API. It is essentially a wrapper for the raw [HTTP API](/api) and intended to make working with it more convenient. If you are not that comfortable with Python, the API can also be used in other languages via a simple HTTP client library that supports exchanging json requests.

You can find the source code at https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe-python-api.

The primary use cases for the Python API are:

- Automatic import and migration of lots of servers from other sources where configuring them manually it would take too much time, e.g. if you want to migrate ~1000 servers to XPipe. There are only limited migration tools for other tools, so using the API makes sense, especially when it comes to also importing secrets.
- Automated management of a fleet of servers. For example, upgrading or configuring a tool on all servers. Especially when the workflow is more than just running a command, e.g., different control flows based on the server configuration. Furthermore, this allows for an automated aggregation of results to check whether the task completed successfully on all systems.

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install xpipe_api
```

## Connecting to the XPipe application

To start out, you need to enable the API access in the XPipe settings. You can find that under **Settings** -> **HTTP API**. For only local API access, you don't need to worry about the API key in the settings menu.

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

# By default, Client() will read an access key from the file xpipe_auth on the local filesystem
# and talk to the XPipe HTTP server on localhost.
client = Client()

# If you want to connect to a PTB build of XPipe, you have to configure the client with that information
# as the PTB releases use a different port
client = Client(ptb=True)

# To connect to a remote instance with an API key
# This is a rather uncommon use case, but still possible nevertheless
client = Client(token="foo", base_url = "http://servername:21721")
```

There's also an async version of the client that can be accessed as AsyncClient. All calls are run asynchronously with that client. This page will only cover the sync client though.

```python
import asyncio
from xpipe_api import AsyncClient

async def main():
    client = AsyncClient()

    # Do your stuff async

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Querying connections

A connection reference is just a UUID string. You can query one or multiple existing connections stored in XPipe based on various filters.

[**API reference**](/api/connection-query)

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

client = Client()

# connection_query accepts glob-based filters on the category, connection name, and connection type

# Find all connections in the default category and all its subcategories
connections = client.connection_query(categories="Default/**")

# Find all connections in the default category without any subcategories
connections = client.connection_query(categories="Default/*")

# Find all top level connections in the default category
connections = client.connection_query(categories="Default", connections="*")

# Find all connections in the default category, including any sub connections
connections = client.connection_query(categories="Default", connections="**")

# Find all SSH config connections on the local machine
connections = client.connection_query(categories="Default", connections="Local Machine/SSH user config/*")

# Find only ssh config host connections in the "MyCategory" category that has the word "MyCompany" in its name
# - Searching for strings is case-insensitive here
# - This will not include subcategories of "MyCategory"
# - You can find all the available connection type names by just querying all connections and taking a look add the individual type names of the connections.
connections = client.connection_query(categories="MyCategory", types="sshConfigHost", connections="*MyCompany*")

# Query a specific connection by name in a category
# This will only return one element, so we can just access that
connection = client.connection_query(categories="MyCategory", connections="MyConnectionName")[0]

# Query the local machine connection
connection = client.connection_query(connections="Local Machine")[0]

# A connection reference is just a UUID string, so you can also specify it fixed
# If you have the HTTP API setting enabled in XPipe, you can copy the API UUID of a connection in its context menu
connection = "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b"
```

## Getting connection information

Since each connection reference is just a UUID string, you have to retrieve information for it using another API call.

[**API reference**](/api/connection-info)

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

client = Client()

# Returns an array of UUID strings
connections = client.connection_query(categories="Default/**")

# Works in bulk, so it expects an array of connections
infos = client.connection_info(connections)
# Get the first info
info = infos[0]

# The connection UUID
uuid = info["connection"]
# This is an array containing all category hierarchy names
category = info["category"]
# This is an array containing all connection hierarchy names
name = info["name"]
# This is the connection type name that you can use in the query
type = info["type"]
# There is also some other data for internal state management, e.g. if a tunnel is running for example
```

## Adding connections

You can add custom connections as well.

[**API reference**](/api/connection-add)

The schema for each connection type is not publicly documented as it might be subject to change. However, you can see the current active schemas for every connection and use that as a basis.

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

client = Client()

# The connection reference to the connection you want to expect the schema of
# If you have the HTTP API setting enabled in XPipe, you can copy the API UUID of a connection in its context menu
connection = "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b"

# The schema is just a json object
schema = client.connection_info(connections)[0]["config"]
```

For an SSH connection, it could, for example, look something like this if it references an existing identity:

```json
{
  "type" : "ssh",
  "proxy" : "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b",
  "host" : "myip.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com",
  "port" : 22,
  "identity" : {
    "type" : "ref",
    "ref" : "34c7ea9a-b00d-45e1-a324-78ef0750acc2"
  },
  "dontInteractWithSystem" : false,
  "forwardX11" : false,
  "jumpServer" : false,
  "additionalOptions" : null
}
```

or something like this if it has encrypted credentials configured in-place:

```json
{
  "type" : "ssh",
  "proxy" : "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b",
  "host" : "myip.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com",
  "port" : 22,
  "identity" : {
    "type" : "inPlace",
    "identityStore" : {
      "type" : "localIdentity",
      "username" : "User",
      "password" : {
        "secret" : {
          "type" : "locked",
          "encryptedValue" : "PTSOUnuY4eNTakHvnhZdbPuxBwYLD3FtUl-V_AL_W0jVVrdGeJtTntcHjrXK8aXqv4_eRYE3HkBKSosBWFOrEkygWMbqTrjwUlFyG8O0htvnsuSJdkPqoYA8bEbOgcdk_PbeSWEWqlODHNnx9f-c3PSh4zas57AycebWoIYPZx1wgQdZ2HdBtlFhpn3HL25CbvL8woPH8S7FDqN1C0x7cdujMKlynMKIZ2qg"
        },
        "encryptedToken" : {
          "token" : "5wuy5IADZvzjAl0IKurM66C6SMZsOuhStsdX8nGZvg=="
        }
      },
      "sshIdentity" : {
        "secret" : {
          "type" : "locked",
          "encryptedValue" : "zPcMsYaHh9n0QcTdliQ94PQAV4mdAGnIz8N_OcVC58-f7F9shDUDIUTqL0PFSAoewpzM"
        },
        "encryptedToken" : {
          "token" : "5wuy5IADZvzjAl0IKurM66C6SMZsOuhStsdX8nGZvg=="
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "dontInteractWithSystem" : false,
  "forwardX11" : false,
  "jumpServer" : false,
  "additionalOptions" : null
}
```

### Encrypting secrets

Based on that information, you can create your own connections via the API. The challenge here is encrypting secrets so that they can be stored correctly. But this is also possible via the API:

```python
encrypted_password = client.secret_encrypt("passw0rd")
# {'secret': {'type': 'locked', 'encryptedValue': '5Tqtd68uFhef8evQV8fKG9nXisgRb2wvfdgeV8LdbxB1V6qi'}, 'encryptedToken': {'token': 'xmz9eAjJ4ms4yqIv9lrYhnsm1RhJVw0AijOee1IZew=='}}
print(encrypted_password)

decrypted_password = client.secret_decrypt(encrypted_password)
# passw0rd
print(decrypted_password)
```

Note that you can't decrypt the secrets of these samples yourself if you try it as your XPipe instance uses another unique encryption key. If you're also using a custom vault user passphrase, then the encryption key is unique to your user as well.

### Encrypting key information

For SSH, any identities like key references also need to be encrypted. XPipe itself doesn't store the private keys itself, it will only keep references like a file path. These are, however, still encrypted.

With that, you can now create connection schemas and add them like this:

```python
# No SSH key is used at all
raw_key = '''{
    "type" : "none"
}'''

encrypted_key = client.secret_encrypt(raw_key)
# {'secret': {'type': 'locked', 'encryptedValue': '0N_LSNW_Gu_kz-HzBmNC5VcMY7kJuIN-Dam0bv370fSTgIJyGPENklzovp_9kCdvPS206m-giPr-fVfV6Q=='}, 'encryptedToken': {'token': 'bDTjRHsCMgvwPiXPEt5xF6JbLuj5UuaBSheF75pB5A=='}}
print(encrypted_key)
```

There are also other types of schemas for keys available. For example, to use a specific key file, you would use the following schema and encrypt it:

```python
# SSH key file is used
raw_key = '''{
  "type" : "file",
  "file" : "C:/Users/User/.ssh/key.pem",
  "password" : {
    "type" : "none"
  }
}'''

encrypted_key = client.secret_encrypt(raw_key)
```

Of course, there are also more variants for SSH keys. To inspect the key information of an existing connection, you can use the `secret_decrypt` function.

### Putting it together

Now that the password and key information have been encrypted, you can add a new connection with credentials:

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

client = Client()

# The connection schema
data = {
    "type": "ssh",
    "proxy": "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b",
    "host" : "myip.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com",
    "port" : 22,
     "identity" : {
        "type" : "inPlace",
        "identityStore" : {
          "type" : "localIdentity",
          "username" : "User",
          "password" : encrypted_password,
          "sshIdentity" : encrypted_key
        }
      },
    "dontInteractWithSystem" : False,
    "forwardX11" : False,
    "jumpServer" : False,
    "additionalOptions" : None
}

# The target category to put this connection into
category = "97458c07-75c0-4f9d-a06e-92d8cdf67c40"

# The validate option controls whether XPipe should verify that a connection can be established to the system
client.connection_add(name="My Connection", conn_data=data, validate=True, category=category)
```

### Using reusable identities

To skip the need to pass secrets in-place, you can also create identities instead. Once you have created an identity in XPipe, you can then just use the identity UUID as a reference:

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

client = Client()

# The connection schema
data = {
    "type": "ssh",
    "proxy": "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b",
    "host" : "myip.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com",
    "port" : 22,
     "identity" : {
        "type" : "ref",
        "ref" : "34c7ea9a-b00d-45e1-a324-78ef0750acc2"
      },
    "dontInteractWithSystem" : False,
    "forwardX11" : False,
    "jumpServer" : False,
    "additionalOptions" : None
}
```

This will make the connection creation much easier. You can also create identites through the same API and with the same encrypted values for the password and SSH key; however, it is easier to use in the GUI.

### Adding other connections

While the process of adding an SSH connection has been quite complex due to the encryption, other ways aren't that complex.

To start off, you can also skip adding any data you don't want to include and instead leave it empty. This will still add the connection, but will keep it in an invalid state where you have to configure any missing data in the XPipe interface if you click on it. If you are looking to just import the hostnames first without all the secrets, assigning `"identity": None` also works.

Furthermore, most connection types, for example shell environments, do not require any secrets and can therefore be created much easier:

```python
data = {
    "type": "shellEnvironment",
    "commands": "echo test",
    "host": "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b",
    "shell": "pwsh",
    "elevated": False,
    "user": None,
    "scripts": None
}
```

## Actions

You can perform actions for the desktop application from the API as well. For more information on actions in general, see the [actions](/actions) page.

[**API reference**](/api/action)

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

client = Client()

# Opens a terminal session for a connection
client.action(json.loads('''{
  "id" : "open"
  "ref" : "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b"
}'''), confirm=False)

# Toggles the session state for a connection. If this connection is a tunnel, then this operation will start or stop the tunnel
client.action(json.loads('''{
  "id" : "toggleStore",
  "ref" : "4dc0c7d4-083e-446e-8a75-7a29490eaec1",
  "enabled" : true,
}'''), confirm=False)

# Run a file browser action like chmod
client.action(json.loads('''{
  "id" : "chmod",
  "ref" : "1aa86bc3-9ab8-4b2e-b3bc-dd028d142faf",
  "files" : [ "/home/ubuntu/archive.tar.gz" ],
  "permissions" : "755",
  "recursive" : false
}'''), confirm=False)

# The confirm option gives you a GUI dialog to first confirm
# the action with the parameters before executing it to prevent any mistakes
```

## Shell operations

You can open remote shell sessions to systems and run arbitrary commands in them.

```python
from xpipe_api import Client
import re

client = Client()

connection = "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b"

# This will start a shell session for the connection
# Note that this session is non-interactive, meaning that password prompts are not supported
shell_info = client.shell_start(connection)

# The shell dialect of the shell. For example cmd, powershell, bash, etc.
dialect = shell_info["shellDialect"]
# The operating system type of the system. For example, windows, linux, macos, bsd, solaris
osType = shell_info["osType"]
# The display name of the operating system. For example Windows 10 Home 22H2
osName = shell_info["osName"]

# Prints {'exitCode': 0, 'stdout': 'hello world', 'stderr': ''}
print(client.shell_exec(connection, "echo hello world"))

# Prints {'exitCode': 0, 'stdout': '<user>', 'stderr': ''}
print(client.shell_exec(connection, "echo $USER"))

# Prints {'exitCode': 127, 'stdout': 'invalid: command not found', 'stderr': ''}
print(client.shell_exec(connection, "invalid"))

# Extract ssh version from system
version_format = re.compile(r'[0-9.]+')
ret = client.shell_exec(connection, "ssh -V")
ssh_version = version_format.findall(ret["stderr"])[0]

# Clean up after ourselves by stopping the shell session
client.shell_stop(connection)
```

## File system operations

You can interact with the file system of any remote shell as well.

```python
from xpipe_api import Client

client = Client()

connection = "f0ec68aa-63f5-405c-b178-9a4454556d6b"

# We need a shell for the file system
client.shell_start(connection)

# You are responsible for decoding files in the correct file encoding
file_bytes = client.fs_read(connection, "~/.ssh/config")
file_string = file_bytes.decode('utf-8')

# Writing files can be done via blobs
file_write_content = "test\nfile"
blob_id = client.fs_blob(file_write_content)
client.fs_write(connection, blob_id, "~/test_file.txt")

# You can do the same with script files as well
# This will create an executable script in the system's temp directory
script_write_content = "echo hello\necho world"
blob_script_id = client.fs_blob(file_write_content)
script_path = client.fs_script(connection, blob_script_id)

# You can then use this script for your commands
# Prints {'exitCode': 0, 'stdout': 'hello\nworld', 'stderr': ''}
print(client.shell_exec(connection, "\"" + script_path + "\""))

# Clean up after ourselves by stopping the shell session
client.shell_stop(connection)
```
