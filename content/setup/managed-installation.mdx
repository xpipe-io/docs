description: Automating the installation of XPipe on your systems
---

If you're looking for options to install XPipe across multiple systems either using some endpoint management tools, package managers, or your own scripts, this page contains the necessary information.

## Windows


<Callout type="info">Right now there are no separate ARM64 builds for Windows. However, the x86-64 versions also work on Windows ARM systems via the built-in compatibility layer.</Callout>

The [.msi installer](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-windows-x86_64.msi) is flexible and supports managed installations as well. This includes standard .msi properties to control the installation.

You can install it quietly with just as other normal installers:

```powershell
Start-Process -FilePath "msiexec.exe" -ArgumentList "/i `"xpipe-installer-windows-x86_64.msi`" /qn" -Wait -PassThru
```

It also supports the property `ALLUSERS` to control whether it should be installed only for the current user or all users on a system. If you run the following command with Administrator privileges, it will install for all users:

```powershell
Start-Process -FilePath "msiexec.exe" -ArgumentList "/i `"xpipe-installer-windows-x86_64.msi`" /qn ALLUSERS=1" -Wait -PassThru
```

### Chocolatey

There is also a [choco package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/xpipe) that provides the same .msi installers. It can be installed with the following command:

```powershell
choco install xpipe
```

### Winget

Furthermore, there is also a winget package available that provides the same .msi installers. It can be installed with the following command:

```powershell
winget install xpipe-io.xpipe --source winget
```

## Linux

The rpm releases are signed with the GPG key https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc. So please make sure so check any releases against this GPG key. This can be done automatically by your package manager if you import the key.

### Debian-based distros

XPipe provides an apt repository at https://apt.xpipe.io. You can add this repository as an additional source to apt to be able to install XPipe through apt directly. An apt upgrade operation will also install the latest XPipe release automatically.

If you are looking for early access builds for new releases, you can replace the package name `xpipe` with `xpipe-ptb` to install the PTB build of XPipe from the repository.

```bash
sudo apt install wget gpg
wget -qO- https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.gpg > xpipe.gpg
sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 xpipe.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/xpipe.gpg
rm xpipe.gpg
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/xpipe.gpg] https://apt.xpipe.io/ stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/xpipe.list'
sudo apt update && sudo apt install xpipe
```

### RHEL-based distros

XPipe provides an rpm repository at https://rpm.xpipe.io. You can add this repository as an additional source to your rpm-based package manager (yum, dnf, zypper, rpm, etc.) to be able to install XPipe through it directly. An upgrade operation will also install the latest XPipe release automatically.

The rpm releases are signed with the GPG key https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc. You can import it via `rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc` to allow your package manager to verify the release signature.

If you are looking for early access builds for new releases, you can replace the package name `xpipe` with `xpipe-ptb` to install the PTB build of XPipe from the repository.

You can use the repository as follows:

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc
sudo yum install yum-config-manager
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.xpipe.io/xpipe.repo
sudo yum install xpipe --refresh
```

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.xpipe.io/xpipe.repo
sudo dnf install xpipe
```

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc
sudo zypper ar -f https://rpm.xpipe.io xpipe
sudo zypper install xpipe
```

## macOS

The macOS [.pkg installer](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-macos-arm64.pkg) can be called from the command line as well to install XPipe silently:

```bash
curl --output xpipe-installer-macos-arm64.pkg https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-macos-arm64.pkg
sudo installer -verboseR -pkg xpipe-installer-macos-arm64.pkg -target /
```

### Homebrew

There is also a [homebrew tap](https://github.com/xpipe-io/homebrew-tap) that can be used to install XPipe as a cask. It can be installed with the following command:

```bash
brew install --cask xpipe-io/tap/xpipe
```
