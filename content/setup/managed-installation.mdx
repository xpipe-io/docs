XPipe can be installed in many different ways on all operating systems. Which installation method you choose depends on your preferences and your requirements.

Note that this is a desktop application that should be run on your local desktop workstation, not on any server or containers. You don't need to set up anything on any servers with XPipe.

<Callout type="info">If you are looking for deploying XPipe in your organization and want to use managed installs, check out the organization installation guide instead.</Callout>

## Windows

The .msi installer is flexible and supports managed installations as well. This includes standard .msi properties to control the installation.

- [Windows .msi Installer (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-windows-x86_64.msi)

### Command-line

```
Start-Process -FilePath "msiexec.exe" -ArgumentList "/i `"xpipe-installer-windows-x86_64.msi`" /quiet ALLUSERS=1" -Wait -PassThru
```

## Linux

The rpm releases are signed with the GPG key https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc.

### Debian-based distros

XPipe provides an apt repository at https://apt.xpipe.io. You can add this repository as an additional source to apt to be able to install XPipe through apt directly. An apt upgrade operation will also install the latest XPipe release automatically.

If you are looking for early access builds for new releases, you can replace the package name `xpipe` with `xpipe-ptb` to install the PTB build of XPipe from the repository.

```bash
sudo apt-get install wget gpg
wget -qO- https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.gpg > xpipe.gpg
sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 xpipe.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/xpipe.gpg
rm xpipe.gpg
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/xpipe.gpg] https://apt.xpipe.io/ stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/xpipe.list'
sudo apt update && sudo apt install xpipe
```

### RHEL-based distros

XPipe provides an rpm repository at https://rpm.xpipe.io. You can add this repository as an additional source to your rpm-based package manager (yum, dnf, zypper, rpm, etc.) to be able to install XPipe through it directly. An upgrade operation will also install the latest XPipe release automatically.

The rpm releases are signed with the GPG key https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc.
You can import it via `rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc` to allow your rpm-based package manager to verify the release signature.

If you are looking for early access builds for new releases, you can replace the package name `xpipe` with `xpipe-ptb` to install the PTB build of XPipe from the repository.

You can use as follows:

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc
sudo yum install yum-config-manager
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.xpipe.io/xpipe.repo
sudo yum install xpipe --refresh
```

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.xpipe.io/xpipe.repo
sudo dnf install xpipe
```

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc
sudo zypper ar -f https://rpm.xpipe.io xpipe
sudo zypper install xpipe
```

## macOS

Installers are the easiest way to get started and come with an optional automatic update functionality:

- [MacOS .pkg Installer (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-macos-x86_64.pkg)
- [MacOS .pkg Installer (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-macos-arm64.pkg)

You also can install XPipe by pasting the installation command into your terminal. This will perform the `.pkg` installation automatically:

```
bash <(curl -sL https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/raw/master/get-xpipe.sh)
```

If you don't like installers, you can also use a portable version that is packaged as an archive:

- [MacOS .dmg Portable (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-macos-x86_64.dmg)
- [MacOS .dmg Portable (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-macos-arm64.dmg)

Alternatively, you can also use [Homebrew](https://github.com/xpipe-io/homebrew-tap) to install XPipe with `brew install --cask xpipe-io/tap/xpipe`.
