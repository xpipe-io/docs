## Keeping track of all your servers

Concepts like virtual machines, containers, and clusters allow for more scalable
and resilient systems, but also result in the number of systems which any
maintainer must keep an overview of, growing more and more. Keeping track of all
these systems, whether just to check if they’re working as intended or having quick
access in case something does not, is essential for an efficient workflow. XPipe
provides an all-in-one solution for tracking and connecting to all your servers so that
your team can focus on what's really important.

## Tackling connection complexity

Due to the ever-present issue of cybersecurity, most organizations adopt more
sophisticated security mechanisms for their server infrastructure access, resulting
in a connection process that is more secure but also more tedious and complex to
operate. This can include firewalls, hardware-based authentication, and more.
XPipe supports the latest security standards and eliminates any introduced
overhead and provides unique solutions and integrations to nullify any negative
productivity impact of security measures and get your team back up to speed again.

## Secure data synchronization

In today's world where anyone can spin up new servers in the cloud within minutes,
having that connection information, e.g., the address and login data, be available to
all team members is not a trivial task. It requires a solution that can be used by all
team members and facilitates a secure exchange. To achieve this, XPipe provides
integrations for the defacto standard version control system git. If you’re an IT
company, chances are you already have a system set up to host your own git remote
repositories, either on your own or through an enterprise git service provider like
GitHub, GitLab, and more. You can use this service to host your XPipe connection
data in a secure environment along with all your other codebases. This way, you can
have full control over your data, maintain an automatic data history with backups,
and utilize your established security mechanisms.

## Getting started with XPipe

XPipe can easily be deployed across your user's workstations and doesn’t require
any setup on servers. XPipe is, at its core, a hub that connects your servers with your
own software tools. It doesn’t try to replace any tools but instead integrates with
them. There is a large list of available integrations, so your existing tools are likely to
already be supported.
