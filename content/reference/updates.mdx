XPipe utilizes a continuous release model. There is only one build/download for all users. Some features are only accessible when using a paid plan in this version. This build receives continuous updates that contain changes which can be grouped into three different categories:

- Security and bug fixes
- New free features
- New paid plan features

Any newly released features available in your plan will also be available to you as long as your license is valid.

If you have bought a lifetime license, then there is no expiration date and you will have permanent access to all current and future features in your plan.

It is strongly advised to regularly update your XPipe installation in order to use the most secure and stable version and have access to the latest features. This can be done through the included automatic updater.
