title: HTTP API
description: Getting Started with XPipe
---

The XPipe API provides programmatic access to XPipeâ€™s features.
You can get started by either using this page as an API reference or alternatively import the OpenAPI definition file into your API client of choice:

[OpenAPI .yaml specification](/openapi.yaml)

The XPipe application will start up an HTTP server that can be used to send requests.
Note that this server is HTTP-only for now as it runs only on localhost. HTTPS requests are not accepted.

You can either call the API directly or using the official [XPipe Python API](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe-python-api).

To start off with the API, you can query connections based on various filters.
With the matched connections, you can start remote shell sessions for each one and run arbitrary commands in them.
You get the command exit code and output as a response, allowing you to adapt your control flow based on command outputs.
Any kind of passwords and other secrets are automatically provided by XPipe when establishing a shell connection.
If a required password is not stored and is set to be dynamically prompted, the running XPipe application will ask you to enter any required passwords.

See the authentication handshake below on how to authenticate prior to sending requests.
For development, you can also skip the authentication step by disabling it in the settings menu.
