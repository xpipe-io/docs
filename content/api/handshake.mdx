title: Establish a new API session
description: >
  Prior to sending requests to the API, you first have to establish a new API
  session via the handshake endpoint.

  In the response you will receive a session token that you can use to
  authenticate during this session.


  This is done so that the daemon knows what kind of clients are connected and
  can manage individual capabilities for clients.

  If your client is running on the same system as the daemon, you can choose the
  local authentication method to avoid having to deal with API keys.

  If your client does not have file system access, e.g. if it is running
  remotely, then you have to use an API key.


  Note that for development you can also turn off the required authentication in
  the XPipe settings menu, allowing you to send unauthenticated requests.
