  Encrypts a secret string to be used for XPipe use, e.g. using the secret when
  creating a new connection.
description: >
  For connections, the secrets are encrypted in json form.


  When creating connections in an automated fashion, secrets have to be first
  converted into the proper representation. To obtain the representation of a
  secret of an existing connection, use the decrypt endpoint.


  The secret encryption method depends on your vault setup. Without any vault
  user and passphrase, the secret will be encrypted with a generic vault key. If
  you have a vault user and custom passphrase set up, the secret will be
  encrypted with your passphrase key.
