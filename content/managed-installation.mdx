XPipe can be installed in many different ways on all operating systems. Which installation method you choose depends on your preferences and your requirements.

Note that this is a desktop application that should be run on your local desktop workstation, not on any server or containers. You don't need to set up anything on any servers with XPipe.

<Callout type="info">If you are looking for deploying XPipe in your organization and want to use managed installs, check out the organization installation guide instead.</Callout>

## Windows

The .msi installer is flexible and supports managed installations as well. This includes standard .msi properties to control the installation.

- [Windows .msi Installer (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-windows-x86_64.msi)

### Command-line

```
Start-Process -FilePath "msiexec.exe" -ArgumentList "/i `"xpipe-installer-windows-x86_64.msi`" /quiet ALLUSERS=1" -Wait -PassThru
```



You can also install XPipe by pasting the installation command into your terminal. This will perform the same .msi setup for the current user automatically:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command iwr "https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/raw/master/get-xpipe.ps1" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\get-xpipe.ps1" ";"  "&" "$env:TEMP\get-xpipe.ps1"
```

If you don't like installers, you can also use a portable version that is packaged as an archive:

- [Windows .zip Portable (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-windows-x86_64.zip)

Alternatively, you can also use the following package managers:
- [choco](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/xpipe) to install it with `choco install xpipe`.
- [winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) to install it with `winget install xpipe-io.xpipe --source winget`.

## Linux

You can install XPipe the fastest by pasting the installation command into your terminal. This will perform the setup automatically.
The script supports installation via `apt`, `dnf`, `yum`, `zypper`, `rpm`, and `pacman` on Linux:

```
bash <(curl -sL https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/raw/master/get-xpipe.sh)
```

Of course, there are also other installation methods available.

### Debian-based distros

The following debian installers are available:

- [Linux .deb Installer (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-linux-x86_64.deb)
- [Linux .deb Installer (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-linux-arm64.deb)

Note that you should use apt to install the package with `sudo apt install <file>` as other package managers, for example dpkg,
are not able to resolve and install any dependency packages.

### RHEL-based distros

The rpm releases are signed with the GPG key https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc.
You can import it via `rpm --import https://xpipe.io/signatures/crschnick.asc` to allow your rpm-based package manager to verify the release signature.

The following rpm installers are available:

- [Linux .rpm Installer (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-linux-x86_64.rpm)
- [Linux .rpm Installer (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-linux-arm64.rpm)

The same applies here, you should use a package manager that supports resolving and installing required dependencies if needed.

### Arch

There is an official [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xpipe) available that you can either install manually or via an AUR helper such as with `yay -S xpipe`.

### NixOS

There's an official [xpipe nixpkg](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=xpipe&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=xpipe) available that you can install with `nix-env -iA nixos.xpipe`. This one is however not always up to date.

There is also a custom repository that contains the latest up-to-date releases: https://github.com/xpipe-io/nixpkg.
You can install XPipe by following the instructions in the linked repository.

### Portable

In case you prefer to use an archive version that you can extract anywhere, you can use these:

- [Linux .tar.gz Portable (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-linux-x86_64.tar.gz)
- [Linux .tar.gz Portable (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-linux-arm64.tar.gz)

Alternatively, there are also AppImages available:

- [Linux .AppImage Portable (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-linux-x86_64.AppImage)
- [Linux .AppImage Portable (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-linux-arm64.AppImage)

Note that the portable version assumes that you have some basic packages for graphical systems already installed
as it is not a perfect standalone version. It should however run on most systems.

## macOS

Installers are the easiest way to get started and come with an optional automatic update functionality:

- [MacOS .pkg Installer (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-macos-x86_64.pkg)
- [MacOS .pkg Installer (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-installer-macos-arm64.pkg)

You also can install XPipe by pasting the installation command into your terminal. This will perform the `.pkg` installation automatically:

```
bash <(curl -sL https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/raw/master/get-xpipe.sh)
```

If you don't like installers, you can also use a portable version that is packaged as an archive:

- [MacOS .dmg Portable (x86-64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-macos-x86_64.dmg)
- [MacOS .dmg Portable (ARM 64)](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/releases/latest/download/xpipe-portable-macos-arm64.dmg)

Alternatively, you can also use [Homebrew](https://github.com/xpipe-io/homebrew-tap) to install XPipe with `brew install --cask xpipe-io/tap/xpipe`.
