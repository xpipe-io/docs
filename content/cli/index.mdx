## About

XPipe has a CLI with functionality to interact with the daemon. Note that the daemon executable ``xpiped`` itself does not have a command-line interface. Instead, you have to use the dedicated commandline executable ``xpipe`` for that.

## Setup

In case you used an installer to set up XPipe on your system,
all environment variable related setup to access the CLI executable from the command-line via the ``PATH`` should already be done.
You can easily verify this by typing ``xpipe --help`` in a terminal.

In case the ``xpipe`` command cannot be found, or you are using a portable distribution,
you can add the executable manually to your ``PATH`` variable.

## The XPipe Daemon

The XPipe daemon is the core component that handles the GUI and all requests of the CLI and APIs.
The CLI executable therefore needs to communicate with the daemon to pass the commands that it should execute.
Any executed ``xpipe`` command starts the daemon if it is not running yet.
In case the daemon needs to be started prior to executing a command, you will see something like this:

```
Starting XPipe daemon ...
[ - ] 1s
```

This one-time startup should only take a few seconds.

## Commands

You can also control the daemon manually from the command-line. There are several commands to achieve this:

-  [xpipe open](man/xpipe-open):
Starts the daemon if not running and opens the GUI.
This can be useful when wanting to quickly launch the desktop application from the command-line.

-  [xpipe daemon status](man/xpipe-daemon-status):
Reports the current status of the daemon.
This can be useful when the daemon is running in the background to check whether it is indeed running.

-  [xpipe daemon start](man/xpipe-daemon-start):
Starts the daemon manually. Can be useful to check if everything works.

-  [xpipe daemon stop](man/xpipe-daemon-stop):
Stops the daemon manually. Can be useful to restart the daemon
in case it was started from a headless environment.

-  [xpipe daemon mode](man/xpipe-daemon-mode):
Changes the daemon operation mode.
Can be useful to manually let the daemon run in the background.
