# XPipe CLI

XPipe has a CLI with functionality to interact with the daemon. Note that the daemon executable ``xpiped`` itself does not have a command-line interface. Instead, you have to use the dedicated commandline executable ``xpipe`` for that.

## Setup

In case you used an installer to set up XPipe on your system,
all environment variable related setup to access the CLI executable from the command-line via the ``PATH`` should already be done.
You can easily verify this by typing ``xpipe --help`` in a terminal.

In case the ``xpipe`` command cannot be found, or you are using a portable distribution,
you can just add the executable manually to your ``PATH`` variable.

## Getting Started

There are several ways to familiarize yourself with the command-line interface.
For a full reference, you can consult:

* The command ``xpipe --help`` for a general overview and
  ``xpipe help <subcommand>`` for detailed information about a certain subcommand.
* Manpages, which you can access with ``man xpipe`` on Linux and macOS systems
  when they are installed using the installer distribution
* The online CLI manpages, which can be found [here](man/xpipe)
